<h1>tmux-time-revamped</h1>

**Local clock and world clocks in your tmux status bar, without ever blocking the render.**

[![Tests](https://github.com/tmux-revamped/tmux-time-revamped/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tmux-revamped/tmux-time-revamped/actions/workflows/tests.yml) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE) [![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.2.0-blue.svg)](CHANGELOG.md)

</div>

**14** placeholders · **2** platforms · **189** tests · **95%+** coverage

A local date and time plus any number of world clocks, each colored by the time of day at that location. Reading the clock is a single `date` call, so the status line computes it live and returns instantly. No temp files are touched, all configuration lives in tmux options.

Built from [tmux-plugin-template](https://github.com/tmux-revamped/tmux-plugin-template).

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Non-blocking</strong><br>A clock read is one instant `date` call, so the status renders without waiting.</td>
<td><strong>No temp files</strong><br>Every setting lives in tmux server options, nothing on disk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>World clocks</strong><br>List any timezones and each one is colored by morning, day, afternoon, evening, or night.</td>
<td><strong>Tested</strong><br>95%+ line coverage enforced in CI.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Placeholders

Add any of these to `status-left` or `status-right`:

| Placeholder | Output |
|-------------|--------|
| `#{time}` | local date and time, for example `2026-06-20 14:30` |
| `#{time_date}` | local date only |
| `#{time_clock}` | local time only |
| `#{time_zones}` | one entry per configured timezone, colored by time of day |
| `#{time_local}` | the local clock styled like a world clock: place label, time-of-day color, and icon |
| `#{time_until}` | countdown to a target datetime, for example `1d 4h` |
| `#{time_elapsed}` | stopwatch since the last mark, for example `12m` |
| `#{time_epoch}` | the current unix epoch in seconds |
| `#{time_iso}` | the local time in ISO 8601, for example `2026-06-30T14:30:00-03:00` |
| `#{time_offset}` | the local UTC offset, for example `UTC-03:00` |
| `#{time_week}` | the ISO 8601 week number |
| `#{time_doy}` | the day of the year |
| `#{time_dst}` | a `DST in Nd` warning when a clock change is near |
| `#{time_overlap}` | the shared working-hours window across the configured zones |

## Install

With [TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm), add to `~/.tmux.conf`:

```tmux
set -g @plugin 'tmux-revamped/tmux-time-revamped'
set -g @time_revamped_timezones 'America/New_York, Europe/London, Asia/Tokyo'
set -g status-right '#{time} #{time_zones}'
```

Then press `prefix + I` to install.

Manual install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmux-revamped/tmux-time-revamped ~/.tmux/plugins/tmux-time-revamped
run-shell ~/.tmux/plugins/tmux-time-revamped/time-revamped.tmux
```

## Configuration

| `@time_revamped_dst_label` | `DST` | text shown before the days-until count |
| `@time_revamped_overlap_label` | `overlap` | text shown before the `#{time_overlap}` window |
| `@time_revamped_overlap_none` | `no overlap` | text shown when there is no shared window |
| `@time_revamped_menu_key` | `T` | prefix key that opens the actions menu; set `off` to disable |
| `@time_revamped_calendar_key` | `off` | optional prefix key that opens the calendar popup |
| `@time_revamped_copy_key` | `off` | optional prefix key that copies the ISO timestamp |
| `@time_revamped_mark_key` | `off` | optional prefix key that sets the stopwatch mark |

Icons use seven hour buckets, finer than the five color buckets, so a dawn glyph (`sunrise`, hours 05 to 08) and a dusk glyph (`sunset`, hours 18 to 20) can be set independently. Every icon option defaults to empty, so no Nerd Font is required unless you choose to configure one.

Both full and compact entries show the period icon when one is configured. Full mode shows the timezone abbreviation, then the icon, then the time. Compact mode replaces the abbreviation with short city initials, for example `NY` for `America/New_York`. When nesting the world clocks inside a themed status module such as Catppuccin, set `@time_revamped_reset '#[fg=default]'` so the theme's background is kept around each entry.

### The local place label

`#{time_local}` shows where you are. The default `timezone` source reads the system timezone city offline, which updates whenever you cross into a new zone. The `geoip` source reports the actual city from your public IP, so it distinguishes cities that share a zone and tracks travel everywhere. The geoip request is opt-in, runs in a background worker on the `@time_revamped_geoip_interval`, and never blocks the status line; it caches the last city and falls back to the timezone city when offline. It needs `curl` and sends your IP to the configured endpoint, so enable it only when that is acceptable.

### Working with other time zones

Three opt-in decorations make a row of world clocks easier to read. Set `@time_revamped_relative_day '1'` to append a `+1d` or `-1d` badge whenever a zone is on a different calendar day, the mistake every world clock invites. Set `@time_revamped_work_hours '1'` to dim any zone outside `@time_revamped_work_start` to `@time_revamped_work_end`, so a colleague you should not ping right now fades back. Set `@time_revamped_primary` to the zero-based index of the zone you care about most and it is shown in bold.

`#{time_overlap}` answers "when are we all online" by intersecting the working hours of every configured zone and printing the shared window in your local time, for example `overlap 13:00-17:00`, or the configured "no overlap" message when there is none.

### Countdowns, the stopwatch, and DST

`#{time_until}` counts down to `@time_revamped_countdown_target`, written as `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`. `#{time_elapsed}` is a stopwatch since the last mark; bind a key with `@time_revamped_mark_key` or use the menu to set the mark. `#{time_dst}` warns when a clock change is coming, for example `DST in 3d`, watching `@time_revamped_dst_zone` over the next `@time_revamped_dst_horizon` days. All of this is plain integer math over a single seamed clock read, so it behaves identically on macOS and Linux and never blocks the status line.

### The actions menu

`prefix + T` opens a menu to toggle 12/24-hour time, open a calendar popup, copy the current timestamp as ISO 8601 or epoch to the tmux buffer and the system clipboard, set the stopwatch mark, and run a `doctor` report that checks every configured timezone name for typos. The popup and clipboard each route through a single seam, and the calendar popup needs tmux 3.2 or newer. Rebind or disable the menu with `@time_revamped_menu_key`, and bind the individual actions directly with `@time_revamped_calendar_key`, `@time_revamped_copy_key`, and `@time_revamped_mark_key`.

## Theme color suggestions

The defaults use 16 ANSI color names that the active terminal theme remaps, so the periods match any theme out of the box; for exact hex values, copy one block below.

## Support by platform and architecture

Works on every supported platform and architecture with built-in tools, no extra package required. The local clock and every world clock use the system `date` and the operating system timezone database, which are present on Linux (x86_64 and arm64) and macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon). Period coloring, weekend detection, and compact labels are computed in shell and behave identically everywhere.

## Development

make test    # bats suite
make lint    # shellcheck
make coverage  # kcov line coverage on Linux

## The tmux-revamped family

This plugin is one member of the tmux-revamped family. Every member carries the
same contract in [`FAMILY.md`](FAMILY.md), the same tooling under `family/`, and
the same shared library, all held byte-identical by a checksum manifest. They are
built to be installed together: no member claims a key or a tmux option that
another member claims.

A defect found in one member is hunted across all of them before the fix is
called done. That obligation is written into the contract rather than left to
memory, and `family/bin/sweep` is how it is discharged.

### Checking an installation

With every member on disk, one command reports any conflict between them:

```sh
family/bin/doctor --live
```

It reads each member and the running tmux server, and reports duplicate keys,
duplicate status placeholders, options outside the naming grammar, and any
member whose contract version has fallen behind.
